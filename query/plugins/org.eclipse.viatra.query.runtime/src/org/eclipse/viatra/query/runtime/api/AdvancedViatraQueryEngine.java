/**
 * Advanced interface to a VIATRA incremental evaluation engine.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can create a new, private, unmanaged {@link AdvancedViatraQueryEngine} instance using
 * {@link #createUnmanagedEngine(QueryScope)}. Additionally, you can access the advanced interface on any
 * {@link ViatraQueryEngine} by {@link AdvancedViatraQueryEngine#from(ViatraQueryEngine)}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * While the default interface {@link ViatraQueryEngine}, is suitable for most users, this advanced interface provides more
 * control over the engine. The most important added functionality is the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>You can have tighter control over the lifecycle of the engine, if you create a private, unmanaged engine
 * instance. For instance, a (non-managed) engine can be disposed in order to detach from the EMF model and stop
 * listening on update notifications. The indexes built previously in the engine can then be garbage collected, even if
 * the model itself is retained. Total lifecycle control is only available for private, unmanaged engines (created using
 * {@link #createUnmanagedEngine(QueryScope)}); a managed engine (obtained via {@link ViatraQueryEngine#on(QueryScope)}) is
 * shared among clients and can not be disposed or wiped.
 * <li>You can add and remove listeners to receive notification when the model or the match sets change.
 * <li>You can add and remove listeners to receive notification on engine lifecycle events, such as creation of new
 * matchers. For instance, if you explicitly share a private, unmanaged engine between multiple sites, you should
 * register a callback using {@link #addLifecycleListener(ViatraQueryEngineLifecycleListener)} to learn when another client
 * has called the destructive methods {@link #dispose()} or {@link #wipe()}.
 * </ul>
